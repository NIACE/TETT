The Equalities Tagging Tool is being released as an Open Source project to enable it to be used on any website capable of running WordPress (PHP 5 + MySQL). 

The 'WP-Resources-Manager' module is tested on version 4 of WordPress.

Essentially the tagging tool is a WordPress module containing a taxonomy specifically designed with the Equalities and Diversity sector in mind - see http://resources.equalitiestoolkit.com, which is our (NIACE) implementation.
